# Pytorch MNIST

The first ever Neural net I trained.

Did this when I was learning about ML in late 2020

## Setting up
- Get Pytorch from [the Pytorch website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)

## Testing it out
In the project, there are some images of numbers drawn by yours truly in ms-paint.

```
predict.py --model model.pt --img <image_path>
```
